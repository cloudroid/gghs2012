\section{Introduction}

\begin{sloppypar}
Forward modeling of potential fields
is a useful way to generate geophysical models
that incorporate the interpreter's knowledge
about the regional and local geology.
However,
when modeling in 3D
and/or trying to fit multiple data components
(e.g., in gravity gradiometry),
forward modeling can be a tedious task.
That is because the interpreter is
tasked with simultaneously
constructing geologically realistic models
and supervising the data fit.
\\\indent
These problems are partially solved
by methods of geophysical inversion,
which automatically fit the data.
Conversely,
inverse problems introduce other challenges of their own.
Most geophysical inverse problems are ill-posed
because their solutions are neither unique nor stable.
Thus, they require the introduction of prior information,
usually through regularizing functions \citep{silva_potinversion}.
Moreover, 3D inverse problems are computationally expensive.
\\\indent
Recent developments in potential field inversion
have proposed different regularizing functions
to transform the ill-posed problem into a well-posed one
\citep[e.g.,][]{last_kubik, li_oldenburg, zhdanov_focusing, silva_interactive,
silvadias_adaptive, martins_tv}.
In addition,
several techniques have been applied
to overcome the computational complexity,
like data compression \citep{zhdanov_compression, li_compression},
lazy evaluation of the sensitivity matrix \citep{uieda_planting},
moving footprint \citep{cox_footprint},
and parallel computation \citep{cuma_largescale}.
\\\indent
We call attention
to the method called ``planting anomalous densities''
of \citet{uieda_planting}
that has been further developed by \citet{uieda_shape}.
This method is based on
the work of \citet{rene}.
It uses an iterative algorithm
to automatically grow the anomalous bodies
around user-specified prismatic elements called ``seeds'',
which have fixed density contrasts and positions.
These seeds provide a ``first estimate''
of the skeletal outlines of the presumed geologic bodies.
Then,
the inversion iteratively concentrates mass
around this ``skeleton''
in a way that both
fits the observed data
and yields compact bodies.
Therefore,
these seeds allow the interpreter to impose
prior geologic and geophysical information
on the inversion.
The interpreter needs only to supply the seeds
that specify the body's skeleton,
eliminating the exhaustive task
of specifying the complete geometry
of multiple bodies.
Moreover,
the interpreter is liberated
from the time-consuming procedure
of yielding a reasonable fit to the data.
This allows the use
of more than one type of data
without any added effort.
\\\indent
The computational efficiency
of the method of planting anomalous densities
allows it be used to quickly test geologic hypothesis
of different locations and density contrasts
for presumed sources.
We illustrate this hypothesis testing procedure
with an application
to the Registro do Araguaia gravity anomaly, Brazil.
